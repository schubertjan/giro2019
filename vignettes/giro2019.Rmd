In this blog post I will be looking at different stats from Giro roadbook(s). If you enjoy it and would like to play with the data more, you can download the whole package including the data and all the reports with ```devtools::install_github("schubertjan/giro2019")```.


## May 5
Today's data comes from Giro road book and has been downloaded using the tabulizer package: ```tabulizer::extract_tables("http://www.giroditalia.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Garibaldi_Giro_italia_2019_low_res.pdf", pages = c(17, 18))```

```tabulizer::extract_tables("https://static2.giroditalia.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Garibaldi_2017.pdf", pages = c(10))```

```tabulizer::extract_tables("https://legaciclismo.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/garibaldi-2018.pdf", pages = c(19, 20))```


Riders did an extra 3000m of climbing in 2017 compared with 2019. 2019 sees 1800m more categorized  climbing than last year, or one big category 1 climb. All is building up for week 2 and 3. Unusually late GC action for Giro. On paper, stage 20 looks like the hardest in the last 3 years. Despite little GC action in week 1, riders will end week 2 with about the same amount of gained elevation as in previous 2 years. Week 3 is tougher than last year. Will be extra important to time the form right!

## May 4
The data comes from [2019 Giro road book](http://www.giroditalia.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Garibaldi_Giro_italia_2019_low_res.pdf) and has been downloaded using the tabulizer package ```tabulizer::extract_tables("http://www.giroditalia.it/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Garibaldi_Giro_italia_2019_low_res.pdf", pages = c(17, 18))```.


Below is a detailed overview of all classified climbs by stages. The x axis shows the length of a climb (km), the y axis elevation difference (m). All charts use the same axis to allow relative comparison. The colour represents climb's category.

* Black = cat 1
* Red = cat 2
* Orange = cat 3
* Green = cat 4

Most of climbing action is packed between 1 and 2 rest day. Stage 20 is packed with climbing.
